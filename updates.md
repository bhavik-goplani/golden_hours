# Task Tracking Doc

I'm going to use this file to track outstanding features/overall project progress outside of actual ticket creation.


# The entire game up to the first puzzle:

-   title screen, click start
-   Police Station cinematic plays
    -   Sophie walks into frame (HUD: her face is in the bottom left corner)
    -   she walks up to the desk where the cop is, HUD switches to COP's face, his dialogue starts
    -   HUD changes who's face it is based on who is talking, we need a script from the film team
-   cut to main game screen.
    -   Sophie can move WASD and jump, training graphic pops up to describe controls (press e to interact, wasd to move etc)
    -   Maya is on the left side of the screen, making some sort of crying sound (needs to be inviting though not too spooky so you want to run away), the HUD icon is a crying Maya
    -   collider so sophie can only walk towards Maya, a box or something so that the jump functionality is actually being used lol
    -   crying sound gets louder as you walk towards maya, prompted to press e to interact
    -   there should be paralax technically as you walk towards maya...
-   Meeting maya (after you press e)
    -   maya talks (need script from film team)
    -   once she's done yapping, the whole map opens... BUT the puzzle events are locked
 > note -> I think the open world stuff is cool, but if we want to finish this game we need to make it linear. I propose making the whole map NOT actually open, and the game will force you to talk to people in the right order, complete puzzles in the right order, dialogue will be the same, scenes will load in order.

# things to add for first puzzle
1. hit space to skip dialogue
2. sophie walks into frame for police station cinematic
3. character idle (need stuff from design team for that, not a high priority)
4. explain controls screen (need graphic from design)
5. HUD -> <img width="706" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-01 at 12 34 43â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/dwesty23/golden_hours/assets/120140940/ffac7d61-e116-4218-a970-7f224e638ea6"> will need assets from design team, the face changes based on who is talking, default to sophie
6. prompting press e to enter for interactions
7. 2 customers @ diner who you can press e to talk to
