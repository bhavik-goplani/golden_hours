# golden_hours
Golden Hours is a 2D puzzle and adventure game, where you journey as Sophie as she tries to find her little sister who has suddenly gone missing. Unfold her disappearance by solving puzzles and investigating the town. You wonâ€™t be doing it alone though: with the help of Maya, a young ghost in search of her memories. But remember the golden rule of the golden hours: you only have 72 hours to find a missing person before the chances of seeing them again disappear. 

Solve the mysteries, find the memories, and save Sophie's sister in Golden Hours.
