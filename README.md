EECS 690 Project

The entire game up to the first puzzle:
- title screen, click start
- Police Station cinematic plays
  - Sophie walks into frame (HUD: her face is in the bottom left corner)
  - she walks up to the desk where the cop is, HUD switches to COP's face, his dialogue starts
  - HUD changes who's face it is based on who is talking, we need a script from the film team
- cut to main game screen.
  - Sophie can move WASD and jump, training graphic pops up to describe controls (press e to interact, wasd to move etc)
  - Maya is on the left side of the screen, making some sort of crying sound (needs to be inviting though not too spooky so you want to run away), the HUD icon is a crying Maya
  - collider so sophie can only walk towards Maya, a box or something so that the jump functionality is actually being used lol
  - crying sound gets louder as you walk towards maya, prompted to press e to interact
  - there should be paralax technically as you walk towards maya...
- Meeting maya (after you press e)
  - maya talks (need script from film team)
  - once she's done yapping, the whole map opens... BUT the puzzle events are locked
